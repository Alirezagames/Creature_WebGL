##Live Raptor Mark Demo

**Raptor Mark** is a demonstration of what the **Creature WebGL** plugin is capable of. 

This demo shows **30 fully mesh deforming raptor characters** running across the screen. This demo is using the **CreaturePack Web** format to deliver results that have high performance, great quality and yet compact in delivery size.
